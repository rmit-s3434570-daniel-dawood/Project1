        <legend>Ducky Terms of Use</legend>
       
        <p>Ducky’s service commitment to our members is to always:<br>
            <br>
            Ensure all members have access to clean, well-maintained new or near-new cars<br>
            Ensure that the cars are returned on time for the next member<br>
            Ensure that the cars have at least ¼ of tank of petrol for the next member<br>
            Ensure that everything is done to ensure the safety of members when using our vehicles<br>
            Provide excellent customer service and maintain integrity in all our actions<br>
            This means that we closely manage our fleet, picking up any problems as soon as members report them.<br>
            <br>
            Carsharing works best when members are considerate of the other members with whom they are sharing cars. 
            For this reason, members must follow our Terms and Conditions to ensure the Ducky service is convenient and 
            reliable for all our members.</p>
